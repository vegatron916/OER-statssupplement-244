\section{Use a multiple comparisons method to determine which pairs of means differ; interpret the results}

Read section 5.5.5: Multiple comparisons and controlling Type \(1\) Error rate, in the Open Intro Statistics book, pages 253-256.

Although honestly we don't do this...

\section{Identify Marginal Probabilities} 

Do we need to do this?  Feels like we already do it in MTH 243

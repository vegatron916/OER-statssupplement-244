\chapter{Simple Linear Regression And Correlation}

\section{Check the conditions associated with constructing  a least-squares linear regression model, and construct such a model}

Read 7.2.2: Conditions for the least squares line, in the Open Intro Statistics book, page 341

\section{Specify the probability distribution of the random error term, and estimate the standard deviation of this distribution.}

I actually don't know what this means?

\section{Construct and interpret a confidence interval to estimate the slope of the population regression model.}

NOT in Open Intro

\section{Technology for the least-squares line for estimation and prediction}

     \subsection{Construct and interpret a residual plot} 

Read Section 7.1.3: Residuals, in the Open Intro Statistics book
 \subsection{Construct and interpret a confidence interval for the mean value of the response variable when the explanatory variable takes on a specific value.}
     \subsection{Using technology, construct and interpret a prediction interval for an individual value of the response variable when the explanatory variable takes on a specific value.}
     \subsection{Using technology, input sample data and execute the commands to produce a least-squares regression equation, a fitted line, a residual plot, and \(r^2\); interpret the output.}
